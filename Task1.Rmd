The objective of this task is to predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

```{r}
data_frame <- read.csv(url("http://bit.ly/w-data"))
```

Attach data_frame and plot

```{r}
attach(data_frame)
plot(Hours,Scores, main='Hours vs Percentage',xlab='Hours Studied',ylab='Percentage Score',cex=2,pch=20)
```

Find correlation between predictor and response variables

```{r}
cor(Hours,Scores)
```
We see high correlation

Now we will fit a linear model

```{r}
lmo <- lm(Scores~Hours, data=data_frame)
summary(lmo)
```

Prediction

```{r}
predict(lmo, data.frame(Hours = 9.25))
```

Therfore, the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day is about 92.90.
